 Wnews.1.t:0"Coronation of the Habsburgs in Ukraine"
 Wnews.1.d:0 "After several years of political instability and economic difficulties, the monarchist forces were able to establish control over the Ukrainian SSR. Representatives of the royal Habsburg dynasty have already expressed their desire to return to the throne in Ukraine, where they have significant support among the population. According to information from regional newspapers, actions are being held in the capital calling for the revival of the monarchy and the return of the Habsburgs to the Ukrainian throne. However, not all residents of the country support this idea, and the public is divided into two camps. The monarchical government believes that the return of the Habsburgs to the throne will help stabilize the political situation in the country and ensure economic growth. Some analysts believe that the restoration of the monarchy may also increase Ukraine's influence on the international stage. However, opposition forces and representatives of other nationalities living on the territory of Ukraine consider the idea of returning the monarchy to be outdated and incompatible with the principles of democracy and civil society. However, the possibility of a Habsburg coronation remains open and could have serious implications for the future of Ukraine and its relations with other states."

 Wnews.2.t:0"Coronation of the Skoropadskys in Ukraine"
 Wnews.2.d:0 "In Ukraine, they continue to discuss the possible coronation of the Skoropadskys, if the monarchical government is restored in the country. This became possible after recently the Ukrainian monarchists actively advocate the restoration of the monarchy in Ukraine, and also call for the return of the Skoropadsky house to the throne. Recall that in 1918, General Pavel Skoropadsky was proclaimed the head of the Ukrainian state, but his regime did not last and the general was forced to leave Ukraine. However, his descendants continue to live and work in Ukraine and abroad. If the monarchical government is restored in Ukraine, then the coronation of the heir to the Skoropadsky house is possible. But this is still far away, since Ukraine currently has a republican form of government. However, monarchists continue to hold actions and rallies to draw attention to their ideas."

 Wnews.3.d:0 "According to some sources, Ukraine is considering withdrawing from the Comintern, the international organization of communist parties. According to sources who do not want to be named, leaving the Comintern is becoming increasingly likely in the light of recent events in the country. Ukraine joined the Comintern in 1919, and since then it has been one of the important members of the organization. However, in recent years the Ukrainian authorities have become increasingly dissatisfied with the existing political and economic relations within the Comintern. It is assumed that the possible withdrawal of Ukraine from the Comintern may cause disapproval of other member countries of the organization and affect the international political situation as a whole. Some experts also note that withdrawal from the Comintern may lead to the strengthening of the position of conservative and anti-communist forces in Ukraine, which may lead to changes in the country's domestic policy."

 UKR_Ev.1.d:0 "Today there are rumors that the Ukrainian SSR may create the Black Sea League as a new regional bloc. If this idea is implemented, then Ukraine could strengthen its relations with the countries located in the Black Sea region. It is assumed that the Black Sea League will include Ukraine, Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria. In addition, other countries that are located on the shores of the Black Sea may be involved in the possible future. The creation of the Black Sea League may have a positive effect on the economic and political development of the region. This bloc can become a serious player on the world stage and provide its members with greater political and economic protection. However, at this stage, these plans are only under discussion and have not been officially confirmed by the government of Ukraine or other states that may join this bloc. We will monitor the development of this situation and inform you of any news related to the creation of the Black Sea League by Ukraine."

 UKR_Ev.2.d:0 "In Ukraine, a discussion is flaring up about the possible return of the monarchy. According to sources, the choice of the monarch between two candidates is currently being considered - General P.P. Skoropadsky and representatives of the House of Habsburg. Both sides are trying to attract support from the population and convince them of the correctness of their ideas. One of the adherents of monarchical rule said that the monarchy would help strengthen the state, develop the economy, and increase Ukraine's prestige in the international arena. At the same time, opponents of the monarchy point to the risks associated with the establishment of monarchical rule, such as the restriction of freedom and rights of citizens. In any case, the decision on the choice of the monarch will be made in the near future, and this may affect the political and social situation in Ukraine in the future."

Political scientists believe that such a proposal could be directed, in particular, to Germany and Italy, which also profess monarchist ideals and have expressed support for Ukraine in the past. However, there are those who express doubts about the success of such a proposal, pointing to the unstable political situation in Europe and the possible negative reaction from the world community to such a step. It is not yet known whether such a proposal will be officially put forward and how other states will respond to it. In any case, this initiative may be the beginning of a new era in the political history of Ukraine and relations with other states."

Representatives of the Ukrainian government said that the creation of an alliance with Romania could lead to an improvement in the economic situation in the country and ensure security on the border with the USSR. However, the opposition expressed concern about the loss of Ukraine's independence and sovereignty in the event of signing an alliance agreement with Romania. Representatives of Romania, in turn, declared their readiness to create an alliance and expressed hope for further development of cooperation with Ukraine.

Recall that monarchist Ukraine came up with the idea of creating an alliance with Romania in order to strengthen its international position and ensure economic and political stability in the region. However, Romania's refusal is a serious disappointment for the Ukrainian government, which is now forced to look for other ways to strengthen its position in the international arena."

In a letter sent to the Polish authorities, Ukrainian diplomats expressed their concern about violations of the rights of the Ukrainian community, including restrictions on the use of the Ukrainian language, as well as obstacles to the preservation of the cultural and national heritage of Ukrainians. In addition, Ukrainian diplomats demanded that the Polish authorities recognize the Ukrainian national minority on the territory of Poland and ensure equal rights for it. Representatives of the Ukrainian diaspora in Poland supported this demand and expressed their hope for a constructive dialogue with the Polish authorities. Recall that the Ukrainians are one of the largest national minorities in Poland. They live mainly in the east of the country, in regions bordering Ukraine. The existence of cultural and linguistic restrictions in relation to the Ukrainian population causes public concern and becomes the object of attention of both Ukrainian and international organizations."

As a result of this seizure of power, massive repression and violations of human rights were carried out, which caused condemnation from many countries of the world. The new regime declared its goal of restoring the monarchy in Ukraine and strengthening national traditions and values.

 UKR_com.3.d:0 "During this period, Ukraine occupied one of the most important places in the USSR. It was the largest republic, both in terms of territory and population. In addition, on the territory of Ukraine there were many industrial enterprises that produced not only for the domestic market, but also for other republics of the USSR. An important event was the adoption in 1936 of the new constitution of the USSR, which established the federal structure of the state and secured the equality of the republics. Ukraine, as one of the republics of the USSR, received the rights to self-government, which made its position within the USSR more stable. However, between 1936 and 1939, Ukraine also faced some problems. During this period, a policy of "Ukrainization" was carried out, aimed at supporting the Ukrainian culture and language, but which also led to the strengthening of national sentiments. In addition, in the period from 1937 to 1938, large-scale political repressions took place in Ukraine, which affected many people. In general, Ukraine occupied an important place in the USSR and continued to develop as an economic and cultural center. However, during this period her situation was difficult and was accompanied by a number of problems."

 UKR_com.4.d:0 "In the international arena, Ukraine pursued an active policy of cooperation with other countries. In 1936, several agreements were signed on the mutual recognition of Soviet statehood and the normalization of relations with some foreign states, including Czechoslovakia, Finland, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey. A particularly important event in the foreign policy of the Ukrainian SSR in 1936 was the visit of a delegation of the Ukrainian SSR to Great Britain. As part of this visit, meetings were held with senior officials of the British government, as well as with representatives of the business community. An agreement was reached on the development of economic and cultural ties between Great Britain and the Ukrainian SSR, which was considered an important step towards strengthening the foreign policy of Ukraine. However, in addition to successes, the foreign policy of the Ukrainian SSR in 1936 also faced some problems. Thus, agreements on the normalization of relations with Poland and Lithuania were not reached, which caused some concern in Ukrainian society."

 ################ General tricks for all paths of Ukraine
 UKR_generic.1.t:0 "Industrial development of Ukraine"
 UKR_generic.1.d:0 "During this time, many new industries were launched in Ukraine, existing ones were expanded, and in general, the country's industry was significantly strengthened. The key industries were metallurgy, chemical and petrochemical industries, engineering, energy and others. Particular attention was paid to the development of metallurgy, thanks to which it was possible to create new factories for the production of steel and iron. An important step was the opening of the Krivoy Rog Mining and Metallurgical Plant, which became one of the largest in the USSR. New factories for the production of machine-building products were also opened, which were used both in Ukraine and in other regions of the Soviet Union. Much has been done to develop the oil refining industry. In 1936, the first oil refinery in the Donbass was launched, which produced not only gasoline, but also fuel oil, kerosene and other oil products. In general, in the period from 1936 to 1939, Ukraine became one of the largest industrial centers of the Soviet Union. This achievement was possible thanks to investments in the development of industry, the construction of new factories and the introduction of new technologies. This had a positive impact on the country's economy and strengthened its position in the global industrial community."

 UKR_generic.2.d:0 "In 1936, large-scale reforms were launched, which are aimed at strengthening the combat capability of the Ukrainian army. Changes were made in the organization and tactics of hostilities, as well as in the system of training military personnel. One of the main changes was the strengthening of the military training of officers. New military academies and schools were created, where officers received better training. In addition, work was carried out to improve the skills of the sergeants, which also contributed to the improvement of the combat training of the army. There were also changes in the organization of military units. A stricter discipline and control over the performance of combat missions has been introduced. New forms of warfare were introduced, such as sabotage operations and the use of tanks in combat. In addition, work was carried out to modernize weapons and equipment. We began the production of new models of military equipment and weapons, which made it possible to strengthen the combat capability of the army. In general, the reforms of the Ukrainian army were aimed at strengthening the defense capability of Ukraine. These changes made the Ukrainian army stronger and more effective in combat."
